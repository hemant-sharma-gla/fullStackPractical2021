    Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of 
    a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading
     Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript portion of web site production as opposed to the database 
     or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML
     text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different
     browsers, devices and screen sizes.
